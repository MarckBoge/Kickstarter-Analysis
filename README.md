# Kickstarter-Analysis


Overview of Project

Our client would like us to take a look at KIckstarter Data for crowd funding campaigns for a group of plays that were launched. The client has look over one of their plays named "Fever" and seen how close they were to reaching the fundraising goal in a short amount of time. The purpose of performing analysis on the KIckstarter Data for crowd funding campaigns data is to uncover trends and relationships to their launch dates and their funding goals.


Analysis and Challenges

The Analysis

When taking a look at the data provide I wanted to focus on  when is the best time to launch a campaign. To start I used the parent categories to break dont and seperate from the other kickstarter data provide to only study theater data. Then filter it out to the subcategories to only look at plays. Next I looked and how long the client have been running campaigns and when they started and ended. Once I gather that Data I looked at how much each campaign rasied, what were the goals. I broke them down into the three status successful, fsilaed, and canceled. Lastly I calculated the Percentage of success, percentage failed, and also the percentage canceled.

The Challenges

The only challenges I found want to bring in more data from other subcategories like musicals. A musical could also be a play. 


Results

In conclusion with Theater Outcomes by Launch Date data there is all ways more successful campaigns then failed, and cancel onces. Also in the winter months there are less compaigns started. In regard to Oucomes Based on Goals analysis I found the lower the goal the higher success and more campaigns started. I think adding Musicals to the data my give a deeper look may show more canceled campaigns.
